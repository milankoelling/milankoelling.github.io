# **Introduction**
“In an economy founded on innovation and change, one of the premier challenges of management is to design more flexible organizations” (Hirschhorn, Gilmore, 1992). The date of this statement underpins how long it has already been necessary to realize disruptive changes. Many different types of new structures have evolved since then. One of them is called Holacracy. “Holacracy provides a concrete framework for encoding autonomy, agility, and purpose-alignment into an organization’s DNA” (HolacracyOne, 2019)
Already since 2008 the concept is known and public attention has increased significantly (Robertson, 2015). Nonetheless, practical examples are difficult to find. There are only a few companies that roll out Holacracy as a whole within their organization (Zappos, HolacracyOne, Premium). So, the question at this point is why the concept is presented frequently as an example of ‘a better way to organize your company’ but applied rarely. 
Since this question is complex and includes many variables, this paper will elaborate on only one variable of this construct. Thus, the relevant research question is “From the perspective of a Traditional Organization: Which requirements are needed in order to become holacratic?” Since the capacities of the present paper are restricted, the analysis will be simplified at certain points. Each simplification will be mentioned. 
In the beginning, the concept of Holacracy will be defined. Some characteristics of this organizational structures will be mentioned in order to draw conclusions later on. Afterwards, an example of a Traditional Company will be visualized and elaborated. Afterwards, the two elaborated concepts of Holacracy and the Traditional Company will be combined. The purpose is to find out which conditions the Traditional Company has to fulfil to be organized as a Holacracy. Finally, the conclusion will summarize all points that will be made within the paper. 
## **Holacracy**
Holacracy is a concept shaped mainly by Brian J. Robertson (2015). The quintessence of Holacracy is a purpose-driven, self-managing organization, which is able to maintain strength and innovation at a high level (Robertson, 2015). The objective was to create a more agile and responsive way to manage an organization, which is able to capture innovation from inside, enacting an effective structure that supports quick decisions (Bernstein, et al., 2016). Additionally, all employees would have a central and decisive role within the organization (HolacracyOne, 2019). Self-managing teams are organized and grouped into circles. For that reason, the 

Holacracy structure looks like a set of nested circles, each connected and part of a larger circle without being subjugated by those above.
The whole process is codified in a constitution, an underlying platform, which is considered a set of core rules for defining, developing and enacting the processes of the business over time (HolacracyOne, 2019). 

Characteristic of the practice is, then, that there are no managers leading the company - at least not in the traditional sense. There are some crucial figures responsible to align team members and the work between circles, but they are not intended as traditional managers. Rather they function as coordinator and supportive figures. (Robertson, 2015)) 

Evidently, the concept of Holacracy is more complex than illustrated here. Nevertheless, at this point the capacity of the paper does not allow a deeper insight into the topic. 


### **A Traditional Organization**
Traditional Organizations are also known as a system of “predict-and-control”, it was the most applied one over the past years (Serrini, 2018). This type of organization aims to achieve stability through up-front, determined planning. Processes are defined and must be followed strictly. Changes in processes rarely take place (Chen, 2017).

Moreover, organizational charts are designed as hierarchies. A hierarchical organizational structure is characterized by two fundamental elements: the centralization of ownership and the organization of the supervision (Chen, 2017). Authority flows vertically and upward, and it is labelled by a pyramidal structure.
In hierarchical organizations, every single entity, except one, is subordinated to a specific other entity. Thus, distribution of power is unambiguously, and ways of communication are strictly determined (Barry, 2012). The chain of command lies at the top among few and is distributed to the larger part of the company. As a result, decisions must follow determined processes, that must pass (worst case) through all existing layers from the bottom to the top (Robertson, 2015). 

Noticeably, the concept of Traditional Organizations is more complex than described here, but capacities do not allow an insight of greater detail. Nevertheless, this definition is sufficient for the following part of the paper. 

#### **Requirements for Traditional Organizations to become Holacratic**
Within the following chapter the before described definitions will be used in order to elaborate further on the research question. Summarizing the previous explained concepts, a table (see table 1) comes up. It will be the fundament for the argumentation within this chapter. 
Serrini (2018) stated about the Traditional Organization: “Thought to realize a robust centralized control over the entire company, this model has matured in the initial 1900s and has not undergone any change over the years” (Serrini, 2018). The statement underpins the need for change within Traditional Organizations. 

Therefore, HolacracyOne claims “Holacracy practice can work in any organizational context if the people are willing to commit to the change“ (HolacracyOne, 2019). It underlines the importance of employees or people in general and their willingness to change. Furthermore, it arguments that without the acceptance of employees the change will not take place successfully. The main idea came up already a few years before, when (Hirschhorn, Gilmore, 1992) stated out that required changes are “more psychological than organizational. They are not drawn on a company’s organizational chart but in the minds of its managers and employees“. That is why Holacracy aims at equalizing the advantages of a company’s success between all employees, in order to have all employees seeking for the same mission. This is supported by the fact that old job descriptions are replaced by roles which determine the field of tasks that the employee is working in. Accordingly, managers have to rethink their organizations from a different perspective. 

Precisely, a Traditional Organization has to leave its “top-to-bottom-thinking” and spread responsibility among all employees by eliminating the layers of hierarchy. Hereby, managers who have high positions in the old hierarchy must agree on shifting power, responsibility and thus enable faster decision-making processes. Nowadays, fast decision-making can have a high impact on the ability of an organization to adapt quickly to changes in the environment. Moreover, the relation between ‘leader’ and ‘follower’ must be rethought. As mentioned before, the ‘leaders’ in a holacratic organization do not delegate tasks anymore but work on techniques in order to enable employees to look at the company with a similar view. They act accordingly with the goal that the employee identifies himself with the company.

So, as a requirement traditional ‘leaders’ must renew their perspectives, their personal views and adapt to a different kind of relationship with colleagues. According to Robertson (2015) communication starts to flow much better than before. At the same time, improved communication increases employee’s engagement significantly since they feel as a part of something with the same purpose. Obviously, the Traditional Organization has to enable good communication through adequate tools. 

Finally, it can be said that implementing Holacracy in a Traditional Organization depends on many factors which apparently do not have things in common. That makes it difficult in so far, as there is no ‘all in one solution’ but every organization has to find its own way to practice it. This result needs to be considered as a narrow view, since many relevant factors could not be taken into account. 

##### **Conclusion & Critical Reflection**
Goal of the present paper was to determine requirements which need to exist in a Traditional Organization in order to become holacratic. On the one hand, it has been found out that employees are key drivers of the transformation. On the other hand, traditional managers have to change their behaviors and attitudes towards a more collaborative approach. 

Communication needs to be increased and enabled by allowing communication through all layers of the old hierarchy. Old ways of doing must be rethought, both the purpose of the organization as well as the way how people interact with each other. Another main result is that required changes are “more psychological than organizational. They are not drawn on a company’s organizational chart but in the minds of its managers and employees“ (Hirschhorn, Gilmore, 1992).

An answer for the question why Holacracy is used rarely can be given partly. As mentioned already, the concept includes many unpredictable variables and thus the introduction of such a structure is individually different for every organization. Not every organization may conduct such comprehensive changes without destroying its business. 

Nevertheless, it must be said that the present paper was unambiguously restricted in capacity. Many things like interruption of daily business, change processes and costs could not be considered and thus future researchers can continue their research towards a more holistic picture that takes more variables into account.
